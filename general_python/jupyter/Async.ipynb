    "# Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, by default, operates in a single thread due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This design means that asynchronous programming in Python is most effective for I/O-bound tasks. For example, if your program needs to download a large volume of data over the internet, asynchronous programming allows it to perform other operations (such as updating the UI or processing data) while waiting for the network response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for CPU-bound tasks—where the primary workload is intensive computations—multi-threading (or even multiprocessing) might be more appropriate. This is because asynchronous programming doesn't provide significant benefits when the bottleneck is the CPU rather than waiting on I/O operations."

    "One thing to note is how the main function handles the tasks. When you use `content, msg = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)`, the call to `asyncio.gather()` waits for both tasks to finish before returning their results. This means that even if the say_after function completes (and its result is ready) before read_file finishes downloading, the result of say_after won’t be printed until after both tasks have completed. In other words, while say_after may finish early, the `await asyncio.gather(...)` call delays processing until all tasks are done. If you want to see the \"I'm waiting\" message immediately when say_after finishes, you could either print it directly inside say_after or use `asyncio.as_completed()` to handle tasks as they complete.\n",
