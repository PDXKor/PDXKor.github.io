    "Python does support multithreading through the threading module, however due to the GIL or Global Interpreter Lock, python cannot support parallelism with CPU-bound tasks, however it can with I/O bound tasks, where we are waiting on API requests or other activities which aren't limted by the CPU. However you can use the `multiprocessing` module for true parallelism.\n"
